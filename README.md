# Mapping Earthquakes

##  Overview
The purpose of this project is to display infromation realated to recent earthquakes on an interactive world map.
Through the use of different layers the user will be able to see the following information:

- All earthquakes within the las 7 days, their magnitude and location.
- Earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.5 in the last 7 days.
- Location and division of the tectonic plates.

The map also has different views (streets, satellite, night) so the user is also able to switch between them as it sees fit.
